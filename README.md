```
## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```bash
cd first-contributions
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```bash
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```
For example:

```bash
git switch -c add-alonzo-church
```

### Make Changes

Make your changes to the codebase. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and guidelines.

### Run Tests

Run the existing tests to ensure your changes do not break anything. If you added new functionality, write corresponding tests.

```sh
php artisan test
```

## commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```bash
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.
